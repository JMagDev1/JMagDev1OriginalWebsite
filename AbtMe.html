        <span class="abt-me">I am a currently a student studying GCSE's, I hope to progress to A levels and then on to University where, upon finishing I will hopefully have a Software Engineering degree. I have a passion for coding and doing mechanical projects.
            This is an Iron man helmet that took many many hours of work and time to fine turn the servo movements and I also had to learn how to program a microcontroller called a Raspberry Pi Pico.
            This was by far my most challenging task to date as because of the complexity of is. To do this project I 3D printed all of the different parts (10 in total for the helmet and 4 for the servo arms)
            <a class="link-helmet" href="IMHelmet.html">A full overview of the project is available here</a>
            As you can tell I love to challenge my programming ability and to try out some new projects (while also making the existing ones better). The projects that I have done vary in skill level needed and language used, for example: Python (JARVIS), HTML and CSS (some simple mulitipage websites), Javascript (still learning) and C# (In school).
